          NoName
        </h3>
        <p>
          Boasting a short 35 minutes, this is Chicago rapper NoName's debut release. Room 25 is rated <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/albums/score/metascore/year/filtered?sort=desc&year_selected=2018">the number one album of 2018</a> on Metacritic.</p>
        <p><i>"From beginning to end, Room 25 is a testimony to the power of telling your story and the hope that can be found in doing so without apology. Like hearing the chorus of an old spiritual or having a long conversation with a close friend, each song is intimate in a restorative way." <b>-The A.V. Club</b></i>

          Dev Hynes a.k.a. Blood Orange releases his fourth album, which he produced himself. Features include A$AP Rocky, Ian Isiah, Steve Lacy, Janet Mock, Anne Muldrow, Project Pat, Puff Daddy, and Tei Shi.

        <p>
          <i>"Set over gorgeous production, and serving as a comforting reminder to black sheep and ugly ducklings everywhere that it pays to be true to one’s full self, Negro Swan is a dizzying triumph." <b>-The Observer (UK)</b></i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>"Negro Swan sonically is as fluid as it is fragmented, synthesizing and bounding between bedsit post-punk, desolate dream pop, chillwave-coated quiet storm, and low-profile hip-hop soul." <b>-AllMusic</b></i>

        <h3>Pusha T</h3>
        <p>Push's third full-length album features Rick Ross and Kanye West. West also produced the album. DAYTONA was named best album of the year by both <a href="https://www.complex.com/music/best-albums-2018/" target="_blank">Complex</a> and <a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/best-albums-of-2018/" target="_blank">Highsnobiety</a>.</p>
        <p><i>"The seven-track album goes the distance to add further refinement and distillation to the steely, luxurious drug raps that earned him rap relevance... The album is only seven songs and 21 minutes long, but Kanye covers a lot of ground sonically without getting scatterbrained." <b>-HipHopDX</b></i></p>

        <h3>Young Fathers</h3>
        <p>This is the Edinburgh-based trio's third release, and quite an experimental one at that.</p>
        <p><i>"The end result is fascinating and forbidding in equal measure, and there’s clearly an argument that it’s also very timely: twisted and broken-sounding pop music for a twisted and broken era, replete with villains (the protagonist of In My View, a “greedy bugger”, actively enjoying not just the taste of his foie gras, but the cruelty of its manufacture) and lyrics that appear to swipe at nationalism and toxic masculinity, albeit obliquely." <b>-The Guardian</b></i></p>

        <h3>KIDS SEE GHOSTS</h3>
        <p>Rap legends Kanye West and Kid Cudi team up on this debut release to form KIDS SEE GHOSTS. It features contributions from Andre 3000, Mos Def, Ty Dolla $ign, and Pusha T.</p>
        <p><i>"A seven-track album (it’s Kanye’s current obsession; both ‘ye’ and ‘Daytona’ ran to the same length) can hardly help but feel slight, though the brevity actually suits this collaborative record. It sounds, suitably, ghostly and supernatural." <b>-New Musical Express (NME)</b></i></p>
        <p><i>"It’s both embarrassing and gripping: never boring and often euphoric. ... It makes for a perfect version of a Kid Cudi album, with Cudi taking center stage under the guiding hand of Kanye’s stellar production." <b>-Spin</b></i></p>

        <p>The debut full-length album for the New York-based alternative R&B artist. Features production from Clams Casino, Paul Epworth, and Katie Gately.</p>
        <p><i>"Soil is a crucial psalm; crucial for its queerness, crucial for its catholicism, its pagan roots protruding into sidewalks, crucial for its purity of heart, crucial for how it avoids imperative, softly chiming." <b>-Tiny Mix Tapes</b></i></p>
        <p><i>"The title of serpentwithfeet’s debut full-length soil is perhaps literal then: a return to his roots and a celebration of finally having found his feet." <b>-DIY Magazine</b></i></p>

        <h3>Travis Scott</h3>
        <p>The third solo release for the Houston rapper, featuring some big names - 21 Savage, James Blake, Drake, John Mayer, Frank Ocean, Pharrell, Quavo, Swae Lee, Tame Impala, Sevn Thomas, Thundercat, and The Weeknd.</p>
        <p><i>"Ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date... The record progresses--in every sense of the word---he allows himself to become more vulnerable, more considerate." <b>-The Independent (UK)</b></i></p>
        <p><i>"It is his most fully realized album, but also the one that most strikingly situates Scott as secondary to his collaborators. ... For all the interesting things that can be found on Astroworld, it is still way too long and can sound so uniform that it loses your attention." <b>-Spin</b></i></p>

        <h3>BROCKHAMPTON</h3>
        <p>The fourth album for the Texan supergroup, and the first after member Ameer Van's departure. This album marks a shift in the group's style as the move away from the <i>Saturation</i> album trilogy. It was recorded in Abbey Road Studios in London
          and in Hawaii as well.</p>
        <p><i>"Very much a product of their time, Brockhampton absorbs what they need from across genres, sharing honest confessions from their varied personal backgrounds (the most striking provided by group leader Kevin Abstract) and reflecting its mixed audience as a voice of their generation. Brockhampton have seized upon this defining moment with Iridescence, a defining peak in their young career." <b>-AllMusic</b></i></p>
        <p><i>"The more you listen, the more intricacies you notice. The more you listen, the more you realise just how defining this record will be for the future of Brockhampton." <b>-The Line of Best Fit</b></i></p>

        <h3>Cardi B</h3>
        <p>Cardi B's debut full-length album, which won a Grammy for Best Rap Album, has an all-star list of features: Migos, Chance the Rapper, Kehlani, SZA, 21 Savage, J Balvin, Bad Bunny, and YG. (It should also be noted that there are enough producers
          on this album to form a small army.)</p>
        <p><i>"Her delivery style at best gives delicious mile-a-minute tongue-twisters, enhanced by that distinctive New Yawhk-Latinx accent." <b>-The Quietus</b></i></p>
        <p><i>"Mostly this album succeeds on attrition and attitude, much like ‘Bodak Yellow’ did." <b>-New Musical Express (NME)</b></i></p>
        <p><i>"While the quality of Invasion of Privacy drops off a bit in the second half, it’s overall a promising commercial debut for Cardi B." <b>-The Needle Drop</b></i></p>

        <h3>The Internet</h3>
        <p>This is the fourth release for Hive Mind, an R&B group made up of Syd, Matt Martians, Steve Lacy, Patrick Paige II, and Christopher Smith. It was self-produced.</p>
				<p><i>"More than one or two standout tracks, Hive Mind goes down easy as a whole; an even-keeled, laid-back drift in and out of The Internet’s signature and sophisticated soundscape. Sprinkled with codas and half-songs, the effect is natural, not jarring, like turning down an alley, or rounding a city street and stumbling into another story." <b>-Paste Magazine</b></i></p>

				<h3>Denzel Curry</h3>
				<p>This is the third studio release for Florida rapper Denzel Curry. It features guest appearances from GoldLink, Billie Eilish, J.I.D, JPEGMAFIA, Nyyjerya, Twelve'len and ZillaKami.</p>
				<p><i>"Incorporating varied delivery and production, TA13OO taps into his established style, which combines aggressive trap with rapid-fire bars ("Sumo," "Super Saiyan Superman"), while also adding smoothed-out hip-hop atmosphere and patient vocal restraint ("Sirens," "Cash Maniac"), which was only hinted at on Imperial's throwback gem "Zenith." TA13OO is split into three sections--Light, Gray, and Dark--and delves into introspective self-examination and unflinching social commentary that tackles politics, sexual abuse, and mental health." <b>-AllMusic</b></i></p>
				<p><i>"Ultimately, easily one of the most simultaneously hardest and atmospheric hip-hop albums of the year." <b>-Pretty Much Amazing</b></i></p>

				<p><i>"Part biting satire, part cognitive behavioral therapy, their new collaborative album, Everything’s Fine, is a gorgeous consideration of how simply existing can beat the “fine” out of us." <b>-Pitchfork</b></i></p>

				<h3>Tierra Whack</h3>
				<p>22-year-old Philadelphia rapper Tierra Whack crafts an album comprised of 15 songs, each a minute long, featuring production from Kenete Simms, Nick Verruto, J Melodic DJ Fly Guy and a couple others. It is accompanied by a 15-minute wacky visual.</p><br>

				<p><i>"Simply put, the songs feel unfinished, which is a shame because — and here’s the crazy part — they’re all so good. Even without the video clips, Whack is able to express nearly every emotion a woman can experience in a 24-hour period, backed by a myriad of musical styles." <b>-HipHopDX</b></i></p>
        <p><i>"Ms. Whack made a cohesive mini-album that can also function as a comment on streaming and social media." <b>-The New York Times</b></i></p>
