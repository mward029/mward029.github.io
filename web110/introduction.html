      <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I grew up in Hagerstown, Maryland, which was once on a published list of worst places to raise a child - explains a lot. Both sides of my family are from New York, so my fake accent is pretty decent! Last
          year I moved to Charlotte for my first year of college at Queens University. This year I'm barely a part-time student at CPCC. I'm getting a lot of stuff in my life sorted out at the moment!</li>

        <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> In high school I took my first programming class, which got me interested in coding and web dev. I also did a two-year art program - IB Art. It was hard but it paid off and as a senior I got to hold an art
          show with all my finished work. I love both art and computers, so it was only natural I major in Graphic Design once I was shipped off to college.</li>

        <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> Most of the jobs I've had have been in retail. My most recent job was at Music & Arts, a music store... I learned a lot about administering rental contracts for all the band and orchestra kids that rent
          an instrument!</li>

        <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> macOS Sierra, Version 10.12.6 (I'm too lazy to update it)</li>

        <li><strong>Courses I'm taking, and why:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li> <span class="underline">WEB110</span> - This is literally the only class I'm taking right now because school isn't my only priority at the moment. But I'm interested in web development and knowing more about coding.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Funny Story to remember me by:</strong> For extra credit in a public speaking class, I once sang All Star by Smash Mouth in front of everyone. So I'm basically a living icon.</li>
        <li><strong>I'd also like to share:</strong> I have an art instagram, which I don't post super often on, but you can check it out <a href="https://www.instagram.com/maddiewardart/">here</a>.</li>
