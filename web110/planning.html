  Website Goal
  </h2>
  <p>
  The goal is to have a website that gives readers an overview of the various opinions throughout the media on certain albums. Albums will be chosen based on popularity and number of articles written about them, and will include a list of top albums of the year so far.
  </p>

  Page Titles
  </h2>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Homepage</b> - Opinion Heard(the name of the site)</li>
  <li><b>Submissions</b> - Includes a form to send in an email submitting an album we missed or a news outlet we missed
  </li>
  <li><b>2019 Albums</b> - Provides a list of articles that give an overview of different opinions on albums released in 2019.</li>
  <li><b>Best of 2018</b> - Provides a list of the best albums of 2018, ranked by highest amount of positive reviews on external sites.</li>
  <li><b>Sources</b> - Lists the sites used as sources throughout the site and links to them.</li>
  <li><b>Opinion</b> - This is a tentative idea; depending on if I have enough time to make this page, it would be articles written by me giving my opinion on certain albums or musicians.</li>
  </ul>
